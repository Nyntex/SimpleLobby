This Repo contains some of the work I did for my RTS System which 
you can also find here on GitHub. It uses the "Advanced Sessions" Plugin by mordentral 
(https://github.com/mordentral/AdvancedSessionsPlugin) so full credit to this person.
It contains 3 Levels and some UI to showcase what it does. It's nothing special 
but should only show that I'm good with learning new systems and teaching myself stuff.
The First Level is the main menu and server browser, and the second level is the multiplayer lobby.
The third level is the level of my RTS system which I had at this point and is nowhere near completion.
But it never will be in this repo as this should only show some multiplayer and UI experience in UE5
